Bunn: Hmm? What is this letter?
"I knew it. A Christmas tree is the solution for everything!"
The letter successfully piqued Bunn's curiosity.
Bunn: I don't mind that my money is gone. I still can earn it back though.
Bunn: But, this letter is very suspicious indeed. 
After a long thought, Bunn then decided to buy a Christmas tree. 
After all, the old Christmas tree was broken last Christmas.
However, he needs a lot of money. To be exact, he needs $200.
