Bunn went home and set up the Christmas tree in his house.
When he moved the Christmas decorations from the storage,
Bunn gets nostalgic
He remembered that when he was small,
his grandpa would always decorate the tree in their garden
every Christmas.
Suddenly, an old piece of paper slipped between the decorations. 
Bunn picked it up
He was surprised that it was actually his grandpa's handwriting.
Bunn cried, but not long after that, he bestired himself.
He then maked up his mind to inherit and take care of this farm.
Hare witnessed all of this while peeking through the window.
