Bunn went home and set up the Christmas tree in his house.
When he moved the Christmas decorations from the storage,
Bunn gets nostalgic. He remembered that when he was small,
his grandpa would always decorate the tree in their garden
every Christmas. Suddenly, an old piece of paper slipped 
between the decorations. Bunn picked it up.
He was surprised that it was actually his grandpa's handwriting.
Bunn cried, but not long after that, he bestired himself.
He then maked up his mind to take good care of this farm and himself.
Hare witnessed all of this, smiling while peeking through the window.
